## Overview

**Project Title**: Student Grading Management System

**Project Description**:  
A simple C++ console application to manage student records, including adding students, recording and editing grades, calculating averages, and saving/loading data from a file. The program uses standard C++ features and STL containers for efficient data management.

**Project Goals**:  
- Allow users to add new students and assign unique IDs  
- Record, edit, and display grades for each student  
- Calculate and display average grades  
- Save and load student data to/from a file  
- Provide a user-friendly menu-driven interface

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open the project folder in your preferred C++ IDE or editor.
2. Compile `grading.cpp` using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ grading.cpp -o grading`).
3. Run the compiled executable (`grading.exe` on Windows or `./grading` on Linux/Mac).

Instructions for using the software:

1. Follow the on-screen menu to add students, add grades, edit grades, list students, and save/load data.
2. Enter the required information as prompted (student name, ID, grades, etc.).
3. Use the menu option to exit the program when finished.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* C++ compiler (e.g., GCC 9+, MSVC, or Clang)
* Standard C++ Library (STL)
* (Optional) An IDE such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VS Code
